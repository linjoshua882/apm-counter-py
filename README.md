# apm-counter-py
Python project to count actions per minute (APM) to measure productivity

Real-time strategy games (RTS) such as Starcraft II, use APM as a metric of success. For instance, if a player can conduct more actions per minute, they will be able to create more units, and therefore, win more games. For some Starcraft players, it is a leading indicator of skill level and winrate. I thought it would be useful to take this concept and apply it as a measure of productivity. 

This program displays an APM counter on the right side of the screen. This counter is meant to display your average actions per minute, serving as an indicator of productivity level. When you see it, you can determine whether you are in a position where your APM should be higher or not. Should I be in deep thought about a problem and how to solve it, or is this current moment better spent executing? These are the types of questions that I wanted to incept via a visual indicator.
